# 🧨 Cybersecurity Playground  
_Security-focused labs exploring real-world attack and defense scenarios._

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab space — where I explore offensive and defensive techniques hands-on using tools like **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **UFW**. These mini projects are designed to deepen my understanding of network security fundamentals and simulate real-world use cases.
