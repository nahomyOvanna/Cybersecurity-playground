#  Cybersecurity Playground  
_Security-focused labs exploring real-world attack and defense scenarios._

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab space — where I explore offensive and defensive techniques hands-on using tools like **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **UFW**. These mini projects are designed to deepen my understanding of network security fundamentals and simulate real-world use cases.

##  Projects

|  Project |  Objective |
|-----------|--------------|
| [`Network Security: Attack & Defense`](https://github.com/nahomyOvanna/Cybersecurity-playground/tree/main/NetworkSecurity---Attack-and-Defense) | Simulate a network attack using Nmap, configure a firewall with UFW, and analyze traffic using Wireshark to evaluate defensive strategies. |

---

##  Skills Learned
-  Network scanning and enumeration with **Nmap**
-  Firewall configuration using **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall)
-  Network traffic capture and protocol analysis via **Wireshark**
-  Documentation and basic network diagramming



##  Tools Used
-  **Ubuntu** – Target virtual machine
-  **Kali Linux** – Attacker virtual machine
-  **Nmap** – Network scanner
-  **UFW** – Host-based firewall
-  **Wireshark** – Packet analysis

##  What’s Next
Coming soon:  
-  Bruteforce and password attacks  
-  Intrusion detection basics
-  Packet crafting and manipulation  
-  Expanding into log analysis and SIEM

Stay tuned as this playground grows into a full-on cyber defense and offense lab!
